    "# Raster Data Formats\n",
    "Raster data consists of rows and columns of cells or pixels.\n",
    "The cell values represent the phenomenon portrayed by the raster dataset such as a category, magnitude, height, or spectral (color) value. \n",
    "\n",
    " * The _category_ could be a land-use class such as grassland, forest, or road.\n",
    " * A _magnitude_ might represent gravity, noise pollution, or percent of rainfall. \n",
    " * Height (distance) could represent surface elevation above mean sea level, which can be used to derive slope, aspect, and watershed properties. \n",
    " * Spectral values (or color) represent the visible or non-visible \"light\" reflected from objects.\n",
    " \n",
    "Cell values can be either positive or negative, integer, or floating point.\n",
    "The next lab dives into _data types_ and how they are typically used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example raster:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table border=1>\n",
    "<tr><td> 1 </td><td> 1 </td><td> 1 </td><td> 2 </td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><td> 1 </td><td> 1 </td><td> 2 </td><td> 2 </td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><td> 1 </td><td> 3 </td><td> 3 </td><td> 2 </td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><td> 4 </td><td> 4 </td><td> 3 </td><td> 2 </td></tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to think of raster data is as images, which is how they are typically represented by software. \n",
    "However, raster datasets are not necessarily stored as images. \n",
    "They can also be ASCII text files or Binary Large Objects (BLOBs) in databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster datasets may contain multiple bands, meaning that different measurements, such as colors (wavelengths of light) can be collected at the same time over the same area. \n",
    "A typicaly example is that rasters may have the colors Red, Green, and Blue.\n",
    "Often, this range is from 3-7 bands but can be several hundred in hyperspectral systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like vector data, raster data can come in a variety of formats. \n",
    "The open source raster library called Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL), \n",
    "which includes the vector OGR library mentioned earlier, \n",
    "lists over 130 supported raster formats (http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**GeoTIFF** (Geospatial Tagged Image File Format) is one of the most commonly used geospatial raster formats. \n",
    "It may have following extensions _.tiff_, _.tif_, or _.gtif_. \n",
    "The data is stored as a single file in this format.\n",
    "In general, these files tend to be very large. \n",
    "Various other formats have been proposed such as Multi-resolution Seamless Image Database (MrSID) and Enhanced Compression Wavelet (ECW) that stores a compressed version of original data (note, compression may degrade the source data).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this lab, we are going to acquire, open, and visualize some raster geospatial data."
