    "The GeoDB, ESRI Geodatabase (File-based) or GeoDB_File is a subtype of the GeoDB. \n",
    "The GeoDB is the primary data storage model for ArcGIS. \n",
    "It is a container of spatial and attribute data and enables the user to store many different types of GIS data within its structure. Its structure is implemented either in an RDBMS or as a collection of files in a file system. As an implementation of the GeoDB data model, the GeoDB_File is designed to:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Provide a widely available, simple, and scalable geodatabase solution for all users\n",
    " * Provide a portable geodatabase that works across operating systems\n",
    " * Scale up to provide fast performance for very large datasets, e.g., those containing well over 300 million features or scale beyond 500 gigabytes per file\n",
    " * Use an efficient data structure optimized for performance and storage that allows users to compress vector data to a read-only format, and uses about one third less storage space by comparison with shapefiles and personal geodatabases\n",
    " * Improve performance by comparison with shapefiles for operations involving attributes, such as classification or creating overlays"
