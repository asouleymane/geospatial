    "The ESRI Shapefile (known here as the ESRI Shapefile format), stores nontopological geometry and attribute information for the spatial features in a data set. \n",
    "A shapefile consists minimally of a main file, an index file, and a dBASE table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the main file, the geometry for a feature is stored as a shape comprising a set of vector coordinates. \n",
    "This main file is a direct access, variable-record-length file in which each record describes a shape with a list of its vertices. \n",
    "In the index file, each record contains the offset of the corresponding main file record from the beginning of the main file. \n",
    "Attributes are held in a dBASE format file. \n",
    "The dBASE table contains feature attributes with one record per feature. \n",
    "Attribute records in the dBASE file must be in the same order as records in the main file. \n",
    "Each attribute record has a one-to-one relationship with the associated shape record.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shapefile format can support point, line, and area features. \n",
    "Area features are represented as closed loop, double-digitized polygons.\n"

    "## Shapefile Specifics and Limits\n",
    "\n",
    "A shapefile is generally composed of these three expected subordinate files:\n",
    " * .shp – this file stores the geometry of the feature (main file)\n",
    " * .shx – this file stores the index of the geometry (index file)\n",
    " * .dbf – this file stores the attribute information for the feature (dBASE Table)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other files may also be present depending on the generating application.\n",
    " \n",
    "A key aspect of the Shapefile is that it can be a collection of layers!\n",
    "Each layer becomes a 3-tuple of the files above.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is a Florida Coastline file. A command line interface (CLI) tool, ogrinfo, that comes from GDAL can read the file and see that it is a collection of layers.\n",
