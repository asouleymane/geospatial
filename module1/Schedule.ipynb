    "* [Overview of GeoSpatial](../resources/GeospatialOverview.ipynb) The purpose of this reading is to give an overveiw of the area of geospatial data. Note this was one labs from Module 7 in the DSA_SCI_8620 course\n",
    "* [Chapter 1. An Overview of Geospatial Analytics](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/geospatial-data-and/9781491984314/ch01.html) The purpose of this reading is to estabilish a breif introduction of Geospatial data\n",
    "* If you didn't read them in DATA_SCI_8620 or would like a refresher\n",
    "     1. [Open Geospatial Infrastructure](../resources/gisreading.pdf) The purpose of this reading is twofold. First, to get you excited about the potential usefulness of geospatial data science and management on a broad scale.  Second, to get you interested in and possibly excited about how complex such an edeavor can be; and how much what you are learning in this program prepares you to participate. \n",
    "     2. [Geospatial Digital Humanities](../resources/gisdh.pdf) This article shows how geospatial information can be used to contextualize the experience of literature. This article describes a website, which unfortunately is no longer available, that was a digital literary atlas of Ireland. \n",
    "* [Basemap Documentation](http://basemaptutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) This is the documentation for the python library that is used to display basemaps within jupyterhub. "
