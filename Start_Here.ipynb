    "This course provides an overview of theoretical and practical issues encountered when working with geospatial data for both the vector and raster data models. Data access, indexing, retrieval, and other technical concepts are investigated. Important data storage paradigms such as enterprise geospatial databases and desktop GIS systems are explored. Core issues in geospatial data storage, management, exploitation, and multi-data set entity resolution / correlation are examined."
