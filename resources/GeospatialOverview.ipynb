    "# Spatial Extensions to the Relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases are specialized software designed to manage data of basic numeric and character types.\n",
    "As discussed previously, these databases can often be extended to support additional data types and data operations.\n",
    "An important extension is the integration of spatial data types;\n",
    "which adds geospatial geometry or feature data types as well as the necessary operations on said data. \n",
    "\n",
    "A spatial database is a database that has been extended and optimized to manage spatial objects defined in a geometric space. \n",
    "Spatial databases allow representing simple geometric objects such as points, lines and polygons. \n",
    "Advanced spatial databases handle more complex structures such as 3D objects, topological coverages, linear networks, and triangulated irregular network (TIN). \n"

    "Additionally, these computing environments often lack the ability to integrate large scale heterogenous data, which is a fundamental capability of relational databases.\n",

    "\n",
    "Database systems use indexes to quickly look up values and the way that most databases index data is not optimal for spatial queries. \n",
    "Instead, spatial databases use a spatial index to speed up database operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to typical SQL queries such as SELECT statements, spatial databases can perform a wide variety of spatial operations. \n",
    "The following operations and many more are specified by the Open Geospatial Consortium standard:\n",
    "  * Spatial Measurements: Computes line length, polygon area, the distance between geometries, etc.\n",
    "  * Spatial Functions: Modify existing features to create new ones, for example by providing a buffer around them, intersecting features, etc.\n",
    "  * Spatial Predicates: Allows true/false queries about spatial relationships between geometries. Examples include \"do two polygons overlap\" or \"is there a residence located within a mile of the area we are planning to build the landfill?\"\n",
    "  * Geometry Constructors: Creates new geometries, usually by specifying the vertices (points or nodes) which define the shape.\n",
    "  * Observer Functions: Queries which return specific information about a feature such as the location of the center of a circle"
